# Go Pipeline Boilerplate

A production-grade **Go boilerplate** for building scalable applications based on the **Pipeline pattern**.  
It provides a clean architecture for composing stages, running them either in parallel, sequential (short-circuit), or barrier mode, and integrates with HTTP and Kafka out of the box.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- **Pipeline architecture** with three execution strategies:
    - `ChainPipeline` â†’ Parallel stages with concurrent processing.
    - `ShortCircuitPipeline` â†’ Sequential stages that stop immediately on error.
    - `BarrierPipeline` â†’ Parallel processing that waits for all results before continuing.
- **Stage abstraction** (`Stage[T]` and `StageFunc[T]`) for reusability.
- **Clean Dependency Injection (DI)** containers for stages and pipelines.
- **Infrastructure adapters** for:
    - HTTP server (Gin-based).
    - Kafka producer/consumer (Sarama-based).
- **Graceful shutdown** with context propagation.
- **Structured logging** with zero-log.
- **Configuration** via YAML (`config/config.yaml`).
- **Deployment-ready** with Docker, docker-compose, Prometheus, Grafana, Redis, and Postgres.
